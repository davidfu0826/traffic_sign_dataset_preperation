# About this repository
This repository contains utility functions for visualization, testing and data conversion to Darknet format (YOLOv3 training) for Link√∂pings Traffic Sign dataset. The reason why this repository came to existance was because the code looked like a spaghetti mess until I decided to encapsulate all code into functions for cleaner code.

Most of the functions are hard-coded specifically for this dataset, but some of them could used in a more general sense.

**Updates will come probably come!**

# Requirements
Not tested with other versions, but everything should work for an forseeable future.
 - opencv 4.1.2
 - pillow 6.2.0
 - matplotlib 3.1.1
 - seaborn 0.10.0
 - pandas 1.0.3

# Usage
Follow the following notebook to se examples of usage

<TODO: INSERT LINK HERE>

# Functions
In the following segment, very useful functions are listed:

## CLI commands
`visualization.py`
- Display an image with bounding boxes given data in Darknet format
  - `imshow_darknet(jpg_path: str, txt_path: str, names_path: str, figsize: Tuple[int,int] = (10, 10)) -> None`
  - Example CLI usage: `$ python3 -c "from visualization import imshow_darknet; imshow_darknet('image/img05.jpg', 'labels/img05.txt', 'something/metadata.data')"`
  
## Functions that can be used in python script/notebooks
`visualization.py`
- Display two horizontal histograms given two lists
  - `two_stacked_horizontal_histogram(first_arr: List[str], second_arr: List[str], title: str = "Distribution of classes with the mirrored images", xlabel: str = "Frequency", ylabel: str = "Classes", legend: Tuple[str,str] = ('Original data', 'Mirrored')) -> None`
  
- Display a horizontal histogram given a list
  - `horizontal_histogram_counts(data: pd.Series, title: str, figsize: Tuple[int,int] = (15, 15)) -> None`

`tests.py`
- Confirm/Check that there is an annotation (/labels/\*\*.txt) for each image (/images/\*\*.jpg) in Darknet format
  - `test_darknet_txt_paths(path_to_samples_list: str)`

The rest of functions are hard-coded and too specific to the dataset, therefore they won't be described here (if you insist, look in the notebook).
